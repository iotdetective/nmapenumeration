IoT Detective NMAP Enumeration Script

This is a script which uses NMAP to perform enumeration with basic switces that are most often used for enumeration.  This script
is designed as a quick tool to be able to identify targets on a local area network and perform basic scanning.  The script also saves all
reports generated during your session to a file name of your choosing within the /tmp/ directory for later use.  This is my first script,
I have designed it for my own use but wanted to share this with others so they can add or edit the script to perform the tasks needed for
their own specific use cases.
